Alcantara
=========

Qt based launcher similar in spirit to dmenu but graphical.

It features a dynamic search and although Alcantara assumes you often type the first letters of the desired program, 
you could also be typing a fragment from the middle or end of the name. In this respect it is more advanced than dmenu.

Also it keeps track of opened programs by keeping their id's and my intention is to enable, through dbus, the retrieval of
pid's (and names) to be used by taskbars and else.
